# IP3Final

A lot of work has gone into the project so far and the hard work has been recognised and appreciated.
Unfortunately it has become too complicated.

Moving forward the project is being rolled back.
It is essential that every basic task is ticked off on the brief given to us by Ideagen.

The programming languages we will be using to do this are as follows:
1. HTML
2. SCSS / CSS
3. Javascript
4. JQuery
5. JSON
6. PHP
7. SQL
8. Java

We all need to have XAMPP loaded onto our computers.
Other suggested coding programs are:
1. IntelliJ
2. Brackets
3. NetBeans

It has been asked by the lecturers and Ideagen a few times what Framework we are using.
Please suggest options to the Group so we can give them a straight answer.

This README will be updated as we go along and everyone will be informed immediately on Hangouts and Trello
